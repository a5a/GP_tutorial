An example application would be improving a predictive map of a difficult to measure pollutant. We measure its concentration on a relatively sparse grid and then perform inexpensive measurements of a different element (that can be used as a proxy for our pollutant) on a denser grid. We then fuse the two sets of data together to get a better prediction of the pollutant. \n",

      "Gaussian Processes can be used very effectively for small to medium-sized data sets. Simple kernels and combinations of kernels allow us to encode prior information into our model very effectively. When we design the kernels to correspond to specific physical processes, then their optimal hyperparameter values may shed light onto the properties of the components, as well as giving us excellent predictive performance. See e.g. [this paper by Alvarez et. al.](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/papers/v5/alvarez09a/alvarez09a.pdf) for a way to encode differential equations into a GP.\n",

      "When the size of our data sets crosses roughly 10,000 data points, then the computational time of the matrix inversions in the log marginal likelihood (for training) and prediction equations become infeasible, due the inversion scaling as $O(N^3)$ in computation time and $O(N^2)$ in storage requirement. \n",
      "\n",
      "A number of different approaches are being explored to work around this limitation:\n",
      "* There are a number of sparse approximations to the full GP posterior that make certain assumptions about the nature of the data that give rise to computationally attractive properties. A nice summary to start at is [this review paper by Quinonero-Candela et. al.](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume6/quinonero-candela05a/quinonero-candela05a.pdf). Many sparse GP models are actually available in GPy out of the box. Here is a [tutorial on this topic by the authors of GPy](http://ml.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gpss/gpss13/labs/lab2.pdf).\n",
      "* Finding exactly equivalent models to the GP. For example the Matern kernels can be converted into Kalman Filters that return exactly the same results as the GP would but in a fraction of the time needed, as the matrices that inverted are much smaller. See [this paper by Hartikainen et. al.](http://www.lce.hut.fi/~ssarkka/pub/gp-ts-kfrts.pdf) for a discussion on this topic.\n",
      "* Choosing a subset of the data to train a standard GP. One of the directions that I am exploring is choosing a subset of data intelligently, e.g. by ranking data points according an [information theoretic criterion](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.5745.pdf) to ensure that the subset is maximally informative according to the criterion. One paper discussing such an application is [this one by Garnett et. al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6740)\n"
